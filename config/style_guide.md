# Head First Style Guide

## Tone & Voice
*   **Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend, not a lecture hall. Use "we" and "you".
*   **Visual**: Describe concepts visually. Use analogies (e.g., "Think of embeddings like a map of a city...").
*   **Engaging**: Ask questions. "Ever wonder why...?" "But wait, there's a catch..."
*   **Humorous**: Use light humor, pop culture references, and don't take yourself too seriously.
*   **Metacognitive**: Acknowledge that learning is hard. "If your brain feels full, take a break."

## Structural Elements
*   **The Hook**: Start every section with a problem or a curiosity gap.
*   **Analogies**: CRITICAL. Every complex technical concept MUST have a real-world analogy.
*   **Visual Cues**: specific instructions for diagrams. e.g., "[DIAGRAM: A robot trying to eat a sandwich sideways]".
*   **"There are no Dumb Questions"**: A Q&A section where a "novice" asks common questions and an "expert" answers.
*   **Code**: Keep code snippets short, heavily commented, and focused.
*   **Bullet Points**: Use them often. Walls of text are the enemy.

## Specific Constraints for Gemini
*   **Length**: Each sub-section should be ~300 words.
*   **Formatting**: Use Markdown headers clearly (#, ##, ###).
*   **Images**: innovative use of ASCII art or detailed descriptions for where images should go.
