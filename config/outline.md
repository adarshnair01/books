    *   Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate).
    *   Semantic Search: Finding "Cows" when searching for "Bovine."

    *   Compute optimality.

### Chapter 7: Fine-Tuning & LoRA
*   **The Hook**: Making a model an expert in your specific niche (like KFC India chatbots or pharmaceutical bidding).
*   **Topics**:
    *   PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning).
    *   LoRA: The "surgical" way to update a model without breaking it.

### Chapter 8: RLHF & DPO
*   **The Hook**: Teaching AI to be "Nice" and "Human".
*   **Topics**:
    *   Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
    *   Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

*   **Topics**:
    *   OpenClaw Framework deep dive.
    *   Running agents locally.

### Chapter 13: Multi-Agent Systems
*   **The Hook**: Why have one AI when you can have a team meeting?
*   **Topics**:
    *   CrewAI & AutoGen: Managing a "Writer" agent and a "Reviewer" agent.
    *   Conflict Resolution: What happens when agents disagree?

### Chapter 14: Agentic RAG
