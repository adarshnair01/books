                The morning mist clung to the valley floor like a secret that refused to be shared. Elias watched from the high balcony, his fingers traced the rough edge of the stone railing, colder than he had expected for midsummer. It was in these moments—the bridge between night and dawn—that the world felt most honest.
            </p>
<p class="mb-6 text-indent">
                There was a stillness here that the city had never offered. In the capital, every silence was merely a pause between noises, a sharp breath taken before the next carriage rattled across the cobblestones or the next merchant cried out his wares. But here, the silence was substantial. It had weight. It had a texture, like the heavy linen of the sheets he had just abandoned.
            </p>
<p class="mb-6 text-indent">
                He pulled his cloak tighter around his shoulders. Somewhere in the distance, a bird called—a sharp, piercing note that didn't break the quiet so much as define it. He thought of the letter resting on his desk inside. The wax seal remained unbroken, though he had stared at it for hours by candlelight. 
            </p>
<p class="mb-6 text-indent">
                "We are defined not by the choices we make," his father used to say, "but by the ones we are too afraid to consider." Elias hadn't understood that as a boy. He had thought choice was a simple matter of crossroads and directions. He hadn't realized that most choices are made in the dark, without maps, while the rest of the world sleeps.

                The sun began to crest the eastern peaks, bleeding a pale, watery gold into the grey. The mist started to thin, revealing the jagged lines of the pines below. Elias finally turned away from the view. The room inside was dim, smelling faintly of cedar and old paper. 
            </p>
<p class="mb-6 text-indent">
                He sat at the desk. The letter seemed to pulse under the rhythmic ticking of the clock on the mantel. It was a summons he couldn't ignore, yet a journey he wasn't prepared to take. The ink of his own life was still wet on the page, and here was a hand reaching out to turn it before he was ready.
            </p>
<p class="mb-24 text-indent">
                He reached for the silver knife. The metal was dull in the low light. With a single, decisive motion, he slid the blade beneath the wax. The sound of the seal cracking was, to his ears, louder than any thunder.
